# SQL Learning Journey

Welcome to my **SQL Learning Journey** repository! üñ•Ô∏èüìä  
This repository contains my practice exercises and notes as I learn SQL from scratch. It focuses on understanding both **DDL (Data Definition Language)** and **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** concepts and their practical uses.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ DDL ‚Äì Data Definition Language

**Purpose:**  
DDL is used to define, modify, and manage the **structure** of databases and tables. Commands in DDL affect the schema and are permanent.  

**Key Concepts:**  
- **CREATE:** Used to create new databases, tables, or other database objects.  
- **ALTER:** Used to modify the structure of existing tables (add, modify, drop columns, rename tables).  
- **DROP:** Used to permanently delete tables or databases.  
- **TRUNCATE:** Deletes all records from a table but retains the table structure.  
- **RENAME:** Changes the name of a table.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- DDL focuses on database structure rather than data.  
- Dropping or truncating tables will remove data; caution is required.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ DML ‚Äì Data Manipulation Language

**Purpose:**  
DML is used to **work with the data** inside tables without altering the structure.  

**Key Concepts:**  
- **INSERT:** Adds new records to a table.  
- **SELECT:** Retrieves data from a table, either all columns or specific columns.  
- **UPDATE:** Modifies existing data in a table.  
- **DELETE:** Removes specific records from a table.  
- **ORDER BY:** Sorts query results based on one or multiple columns in ascending, descending, or alphabetical order.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- DML gives full control over the data stored in tables.  
- Using primary keys ensures uniqueness and prevents duplicates.  
- Ordering and filtering data is essential for effective data analysis.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Practical Learning Summary

Through my practice, I have:  
- Learned to create multiple tables and manage their structure.  
- Practiced adding, modifying, and removing columns.  
- Learned how to insert, update, and delete records efficiently.  
- Explored sorting and retrieving data for analysis.  
- Learned to check table structure and database schema.

## ‚úÖ Overall Takeaways

- **DDL = Structure** (CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME)  
- **DML = Data** (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, ORDER BY)  
- SQL is a foundation for **data analysis** and **backend or mobile app development**.  
- Proper use of **primary keys** prevents duplicate records and ensures data integrity.  
- Data can be manipulated safely without modifying table structure using DML commands.
